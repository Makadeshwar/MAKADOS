| Option      | Description                              |

| `--post`    | Use POST instead of GET                  |
| `--threads` | Number of threads (default: 1000)        |

### YOU CAN USE ALL THE COMMANDS TOGETHER TOO. BUT MAKE SURE YOU HAVE GOOD SPECS IN YOUR PC YOU WILL ALSO NEED TO START TOR BEFORE INITIATING TOR COMMAND 
### DONT USE IT ON LIVE WEBSITES AS IT WILL CRASH THEM EASILY
### --THREADS COMMAND WILL USE YOUR RAM AND CPU CORES TO ATTACK SO MAKE SURE YOU OPERATE CAREFULL BY DEFAULT ITS MIN 1000 THREADS BUT DONT USE MORE THAN YOU COMPUTER'S CAPACITY  
### I WOULD RECOMMEND
